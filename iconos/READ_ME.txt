You can find here every icons used in "EjercicioTema5-Iconos.fig" (= the model available with the link in "README.md", part "Ejercicio Tema 5").

These icons are in png format. 
Indeed, I've found these icons in https://www.flaticon.com/ but the .svg are not for free. 
	=> After the approval of our client, we could pay and use .svg format, but for now, it's only in png format. 

PS: every icons in "EjercicioTema5-Iconos.fig" have an effect called "Inner shadow" (available in figma directly)
